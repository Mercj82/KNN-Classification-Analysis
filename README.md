# KNN-Classification-Analysis
This project focuses on identifying the major predictor variables that determine or predict patient readmission in healthcare settings using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. We aim to gain insights into the factors influencing readmission rates and create an effective predictive model.
